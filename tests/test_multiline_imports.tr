# Style 2: Single line with parentheses
from sys import (argv, exit, version)

# Style 3: Multiline with parentheses

    partial,
    lru_cache,
)

# Style 7: Single line with multiple aliases
from datetime import datetime as dt, timedelta as td, date

# Test that imports work
print("All import styles parsed successfully!")
