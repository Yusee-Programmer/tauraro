# Test file to verify reserved keyword restrictions
# These should ALL produce errors when parsed

# This file contains INVALID code that should be rejected by the parser

# Test 1: Try using a keyword as variable name
# Uncomment one at a time to test:

# if = 10  # Should error: Cannot use reserved keyword 'if' as variable name

# Test 2: Try using builtin as variable name
# print = 10  # Should error: Cannot redefine builtin 'print'

# Test 3: Valid code - this should work
valid_var = 10
print(valid_var)

# Test 4: Try using keyword as function name
# func True():  # Should error
#     pass

# func print():  # Should error - redefining builtin
#     pass

# Test 5: Valid function
func my_function():
    return 42

print(my_function())

# Test 6: Try using keyword as class name
# class None:  # Should error
#     pass

# Test 7: Valid class
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.value)

# Test 8: Try using keyword in for loop
# for True in range(5):  # Should error
#     print(True)

# Test 9: Valid for loop
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

# Test 10: Try using builtin as lambda parameter
# add = lambda len: len + 1  # Should error - len is a builtin

# Test 11: Valid lambda
add = lambda x: x + 1
print(add(5))

# Test 12: Try using keyword as exception variable
# try:
#     x = 1/0
# except Exception as True:  # Should error
#     print("error")

# Test 13: Valid exception handling
try:
    x = 1/0
except Exception as e:
    print("Caught error")

# Test 14: Try using keyword as with alias
# with open("test.txt") as None:  # Should error
#     pass
