//! Control flow (JUMP, IF, CALL, RETURN)

/// Control flow operations
pub struct ControlOps;

// Control flow opcodes are already defined in instructions.rs
// The implementation for these opcodes is in arithmetic.rs in the execute_instruction_fast method

// Future work could include:
// - Advanced jump optimization
// - Exception handling improvements
// - Loop optimization techniques
// - Tail call optimization
